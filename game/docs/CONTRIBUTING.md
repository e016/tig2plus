# Asking for Custom Songs
## PLEASE READ before creating a new song issue!

There are a few rules to follow when creating a new issue asking the devs to add a new song:

* Supply two audio files, preferably .mp3 ones; one for the main song; and then a snippet of the song.
* Put the song name and the song artist, remixer or label (if applicable) somewhere in your issue
* Lower the volume of the audio by around -2db:

* Write the BPM of the song in your issue. And don't just guess. **USE A BPM TAPPER** or really *anything* to get the *true* BPM. Also, TIG2's engine cannot handle songs that change their tempo.
* It is fine to "cut" songs in order to shorten the length of the song. However, one must **not** cut the song 
sloppily. I've found Audacity's "Snap" feature useful for these kinds of song edits.
